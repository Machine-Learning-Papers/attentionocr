# Attention OCR

A stable, readable and maintainable of Attention OCR in Keras.

This sequence to sequence OCR model aims to provide a stable, readable and maintainable implementation of Attention OCR.
Some of the open source models are implemented in a way that readability suffers.
Also, these implementations are in Tensorflow, which API changes throughout its many versions.
This makes some of the OCR implementations hard to use and maintain.

## To do

* Name all input and output tensors 
* Build unit tests
* Show a test case on google colab
* Perform a grid search on best parameters for a toy dataset
* Document the whole API
